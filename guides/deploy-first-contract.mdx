Write your first smart contract and run it in your browser without any knowledge about Flare or blockchains.

## Overview

You can write your first smart contract and run it in your browser without any knowledge about Ethereum or blockchains. This guide shows you how easy it is to develop smart contracts using the Solidity language, a MetaMask wallet and the Remix Development Environment. You can use all of these tools in your browser for free with no signup required.

## Objective

You will create and deploy a simple "Hello world" smart contract using the following process:

1. Write: Write a contract to define how the contract functions, what data it can store, what other contracts it interacts with, and what external APIs it might call.
2. Compile: Pass your smart contract code through a compiler to translate the contract into byte code that the blockchain can understand. For example, Solidity code must be compiled before it can run in the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
3. Deploy: Send the compiled smart contract to the blockchain. From that point forward, the contract cannot be altered. However, you can still interact with the contract in several ways.
4. Run functions: When you run the functions that you defined for the contract, the network processes those functions and modifies the state of your contract. For some functions, the network charges a small fee to complete the work. Your contract can also have functions that transfer funds to other contracts or wallets.
