Flare is the blockchain for data. It providers developers and users with secure decentralized access to high-integrity data from other chains and the internet. As an EVM compatible Layer-1 blockchain, complete with enshrined data protocols, Flare offers a full-stack solution for building the next generation of decentralized applications.

## Getting started

- [Deploy your first smart contract](../../guides/deploy-first-contract) — Build and deploy your first on-chain Flare smart contract, using only your browser.

- [Learn how to use FTSOv2](../ftso/overview) — Leverage the latest upgrades to Flare Time Series Oracle, where feeds now update every ≈1.8 seconds on Flare. This is over 90x faster than FTSOv1.

- Start building on Flare with programming languages you may already know

  - [Python](../../guides/flare-for-python-developers)
  - [Rust](../../guides/flare-for-rust-developers)
  - [JavaScript](../../guides/flare-for-javascript-developers)
  - [Go](../../guides/flare-for-go-developers)

## Understand the architecture

Build a strong understanding of the core concepts that make Flare different from other blockchains.

- Flare's data protocols, [Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO)](../ftso/overview) and [Flare Data Connector (FDC)](../fdc/overview), are enshrined into the core protocol of Flare, and inherit the economic security of the entire network.

- [Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS)](../../guides/what-is-dpos) — Flare's users are incentivized to reward honest validators, and punish dishonest ones.

## Contribute to Flare

- [Run a Flare validator](../run-a-node/validator-node) — Secure the Flare network and earn rewards by running a validator node.

- [Become a data provider](../run-a-node/ftso-data-provider) — Support DeFi applications on Flare with high-integrity, block-latency data feeds.

- [Contribute to Flare's open-source codebase](https://github.com/flare-foundation) — Help build the future of Flare.
