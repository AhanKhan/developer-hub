Flare is the blockchain for data. It providers developers and users with secure decentralized access to high-integrity data from other chains and the internet. As an EVM compatible Layer-1 blockchain, complete with enshrined data protocols, Flare offers a full-stack solution for building the next generation of decentralized applications.

## Getting started

- [Deploy your first smart contract](../../guides/deploy-first-contract) - Build and deploy your first on-chain Flare smart contract, using only your browser

- [Learn how to use FTSOv2](../ftso/getting-started) - Leverage Flare's enshrined oracle, the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO), in your decentralized application

- Start building on Flare with programming languages you may already know

  - [Python](../../guides/flare-for-python-developers)
  - [Rust](../../guides/flare-for-rust-developers)
  - [JavaScript](../../guides/flare-for-javascript-developers)
  - [Go](../../guides/flare-for-go-developers)

## Start learning

Build a strong understanding of the core concepts that make Flare different from other blockchains.

- [Enshrined data protocols](../../guides/what-is-enshrining) - Flare's data primitives are built right into core protocol of Flare network

- [Delegated PoS](../../guides/what-is-dpos) - Flare's users are incentivized to reward honest validators, and punish dishonest ones

## Understand the architecture

Get to know the underlying architecture of how Flare works.

- [Validators](../../guides/what-is-a-flare-validator) - Validators are responsible for securing the network and checking the validity of transactions

- [Data Providers](../../guides/what-is-a-flare-data-provider) - Data Providers are responsible for sourcing off-chain data and bringing it to Flare

## Contribute to Flare

- [Run a Flare validator](../run-a-node/validator-node) - Secure the Flare network and earn rewards by running a validator node

- [Become a data provider](../run-a-node/ftso-block-latency-provider) - Provide applications on Flare with high-integrity, per-block data feeds

- [Provide Flare with DA](../run-a-node/flareda-for-ftso-provider) - Provide off-chain data availability for FTSOv2

- [Contribute to Flare's open-source codebase](https://github.com/flare-foundation) - Help build the future of Flare
