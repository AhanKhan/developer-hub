# Introduction

Flare is the blockchain for data. It providers developers and users with secure decentralized access to high-integrity data from other chains and the internet. As an EVM compatible Layer-1 blockchain, complete with enshrined data protocols, Flare offers a full-stack solution for building the next generation of decentralized applications.

## Getting started

- [Deploy your first smart contract](../../guides/deploy-first-contract) - Build and deploy your first on-chain Flare smart contract, using only your browser
- [Learn how to use the FTSO](../../guides/learn-how-to-use-the-ftso) - Leverage Flare's enshirined oracle - the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO), in your decentralized application

## Start learning

Build a strong understanding of the core concepts that make Flare different from other blockchains.

- [Enshrined data protocols](../../guides/what-is-enshrining) - Flare's data primitives are built right into core protocol of Flare network
- [On-chain governance](on-chain-governance) - Flare is controlled by its community of users, who vote on changes to the network
- [Delegated PoS](../../guides/what-is-dpos) - Flare's users are incentivized to reward honest validators, and punish dishonest ones

## Understand the architecture

Get to know the underlying architecture of how Flare works.

- [Validators](../../guides/what-is-a-flare-validator) - Validators are responsible for securing the network and checking the validity of transactions
- [Data Providers](../../guides/what-is-a-flare-data-provider) - Data Providers are responsible for sourcing off-chain data and bringing it to Flare

## Contribute to Flare

- [Participate in Flare governance](../../guides/participate-in-flare-governance) - Vote on Flare Improvement Proposals (FIPs) to define how Flare evolves
- [Run a Flare validator](validator-nodes) - Secure the Flare network and earn rewards by running a validator node
- [Become an FTSO data provider](../../guides/become-a-data-provider) - Provide applications on Flare with high-integrity data
- [Contribute to Flare's open-source codebase](https://github.com/flare-foundation) - Help build the future of Flare
