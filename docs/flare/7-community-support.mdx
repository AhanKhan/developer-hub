## FAQs

### Why am I getting `invalid opcode: opcode 0x5f not defined`?

Flare supports EVM versions up to London. Learn how to set the EVM version for your compiler in the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#setting-the-evm-version-to-target).

```json
// In the standard Solidity JSON interface
{
  "settings": {
    "optimizer": {
      /* ... */
    },
    "evmVersion": "london"
  }
}
```
