Flare has four networks, and choosing the right one based on your work is important. All of the networks are permissionless:

- **Flare Mainnet:** The production network where all the action happens. Transactions cost real money here.

- **Coston2 Testnet:** Flare's testnet, test your applications without spending real money. This should be your first choice when developing applications.

- **Songbird Canary:** Experimental proving ground for Flare, test your applications in a real-world environment.

- **Coston Testnet:** Songbird's testnet.

The most common development tracks are:

1. Coston2 Testnet → Flare Mainnet

2. Coston Testnet → Songbird Canary → Flare Mainnet

## Supported Wallets

Several browser and mobile app based wallets support Flare. Find some options that might be right for you on the [Flare Ecosystem](https://flare.network/wallets/) page. The only change reqiured is to modify the RPC URL and Chain ID.

## Transaction format

- **Address space:** Matches Ethereum, 20-byte addresses using ECDSA

- **Transaction format:** Matches Ethereum, complies with [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718), endoded with [RLP](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp/)

- **Transaction fees:**

  - **Type0** (Legacy) - Fee is calculated as `gasUsed * gasPrice`

  - **Type2** (EIP-1559) - Fee is calculated as `(baseFee + priorityFee) * gas`. Both the base and priority fees are burned.

## Smart contracts

- **RPC-API:** [Ethereum RPC API](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/)

- **Supported opcodes:** All [opcodes](https://www.evm.codes/?fork=london) up to the London fork are supported. In the standard Solidity JSON interface:
  ```json
  {
    "settings": {
      "optimizer": {
        /* ... */
      },
      "evmVersion": "london"
    }
  }
  ```

## Consensus

- **Sybil resistance mechanism:** Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

- **Delegation:** In-protocol

- **Transactions/second:** ≈4500

- **Block time:** ≈2 seconds

- **Finality:** Single-slot

- **Transaction ordering:** Leader's discretion (default behaviour is priority gas auction)

- **Consensus mechanism:** Snowman++ (from [Avalanche](https://docs.avax.network)) offers a high-throughput, totally ordered consensus mechanism alongside a leader protocol to minimize MEV.

- **Consensus participants:** Validators vote on block proposals and serve as leaders. To serve as a validator, a node must meet a minimum self-bond set by governance. Validators are randomly selected as leaders to propose new blocks. The probability of a node being elected leader is proportional to the node's stake.

- **Enshrined protocols:** In addition to consensus, Flare validators are also data providers for [FTSO](../run-a-node/ftso-data-provider) and attestation providers for [FDC](../run-a-node/fdc-attestation-provider)

:::note Adding Flare's native token FLR to your exchange
Flare is just like Ethereum. To add it to your exchange:

- Set up an [observer node](../run-a-node/observer-node)
- Use the appropriate [network configuration](#configuration) for Flare Mainnet
