## Account

A record in the Flare ledger that holds data and can be used to send and receive tokens. An account is identified by an address, which is derived from a public key. An account can be an [externally owned account (EOA)](#externally-owned-account-eoa) or a [smart contract](#smart-contract).

## Address

A unique identifier that represents an account on the Flare network. Addresses are derived from public keys and are used to send and receive tokens.

## API

Application Programming Interface. A set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.

## Block

A collection of transactions that are bundled together and added to the blockchain. Blocks are created by validators and are used to record transactions on the network.

## Blockchain

A distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a secure and tamper-proof way. Each block in the blockchain contains a list of transactions and a reference to the previous block, creating a chain of blocks.

## Bridge

A protocol that connects otherwise independent blockchains, enabling interoperability between them.

## Canary

A network used for testing features under “real fire” conditions, before deploying them on mainnet. All users of the canary network are real users, but are aware of the experimental nature of the platform. The name comes from the time when actual miners used actual canaries to detect the presence of poisonous gas in the mines. Flare's canary network is called Songbird.

## Consensus

The process by which a network of nodes agree on the validity of transactions and the state of the ledger. Consensus mechanisms are used to secure the network and prevent double-spending.

## Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

A consensus mechanism in which token holders vote for validators to secure the network and validate transactions. Validators are elected based on the number of votes they receive from token holders.

## EVM

Ethereum Virtual Machine. A virtual machine that runs smart contracts on the Ethereum network. The EVM is a Turing-complete machine that executes code written in Solidity or other programming languages.

## Externally Owned Account (EOA)

An account that is controlled by a private key and can send transactions on the network.

## Fork

A change in the protocol of a blockchain network that results in two separate chains. Forks can be caused by software updates, consensus rule changes, or network upgrades.

## Gas

A unit of measurement that represents the computational work required to execute a transaction on the network. Gas is used to pay for transaction fees and prevent spam on the network.

## Hard Fork

A type of fork that is not backward-compatible with the existing protocol. Hard forks require all nodes to upgrade to the new protocol to continue participating in the network.

## Node

A computer that participates in the Flare network by running software that validates transactions and maintains a copy of the blockchain. Nodes can be validators, data providers, or regular network participants.

## Oracle

A service that provides off-chain data to smart contracts on the blockchain. Oracles are used to bring real-world data, such as price feeds, weather information, and sports scores, to the blockchain.

## Smart Contract

An account that is controlled by code and can send transactions on the network. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement being directly written into lines of code.

## Token

A digital asset that represents ownership of a physical or virtual asset. Tokens can be used to represent a wide range of assets, including cryptocurrencies, real estate, and intellectual property.

## Transaction

A record of a transfer of tokens or data on the blockchain. Transactions are signed by the sender and include information such as the recipient's address, the amount of tokens transferred, and the gas fee.

## Validator

A node that participates in the consensus process and validates transactions on the network. Validators are responsible for creating new blocks and securing the network.

## Wallet

A software application that allows users to store, send, and receive tokens. Wallets can be used to manage multiple accounts and interact with decentralized applications on the blockchain.
