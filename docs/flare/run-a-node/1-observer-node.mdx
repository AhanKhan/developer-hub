title: Observer Node

An observer node does not participate in network concensus. Unlike [validator nodes](validator-node), which provide state consensus and add blocks, observer nodes remain outside the network and have no effect on consensus or blocks.

## Why run an Observer Node

Running an observer node is optional. However, submitting transactions through your own node offers a number of benefits:

- Transactions are sent directly to the network instead of through a third party, removing a potential security risk.
- Public nodes are usually rate-limited (the amount of requests they accept per second is restricted). Your own node does not have such restriction.
- The time savings described above allow FTSO data providers to submit their data a few seconds later, thus having more time to gather data before submitting.

## Prerequisites

:::note

Enabling pruning is recommended for observer nodes, as they do not need to keep the whole history of the blockchain. In some cases, pruning can save up to 60% of disk space.

:::

### Hardware recommendations

- CPU: 8 cores, or more
- RAM: 16 GB, or more
- Disk: 500 GB PCIe Gen 3 NVMe SSD, or better

### Docker

Docker Hub contains container images for all releases at [flare-foundation/go-flare](https://hub.docker.com/r/flarefoundation/go-flare).

## Deploying an Observer Node

### Configure the node

Clone the repository at [flare-foundation/go-flare](https://github.com/flare-foundation/go-flare) and run the `build.sh` script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flare-foundation/go-flare.git
cd go-flare/avalanchego
./scripts/build.sh
```

The resulting executable will be stored in `build/avalanchego`.

:::note

You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
go test $(go list ./... | grep -v /tests/) # avalanchego unit tests
cd ../coreth
go test ./... # coreth unit tests
cd ../avalanchego
```

:::

### Run the Node

This is the minimum command to quickly get your node up and running.
To understand each parameter read the following step before launching the node.

```bash
./build/avalanchego --network-id=flare --http-host= --bootstrap-ips="$(curl -m 10 -sX POST --data '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"info.getNodeIP" }' -H 'content-type:application/json;' https://flare.flare.network/ext/info | jq -r ".result.ip")" --bootstrap-ids="$(curl -m 10 -sX POST --data '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"info.getNodeID" }' -H 'content-type:application/json;' https://flare.flare.network/ext/info | jq -r ".result.nodeID")"
```

After a lot of log messages the node should start synchronizing with the network, which might take anywhere from a few hours to a few days depending on network speed and machine specs.

Node syncing can be stopped at any time. Use the same command as before to resume the node syncing from where it left off.

You will know your node is fully booted and accepting transactions when the output of this command:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:9650/ext/health
```

Contains the field `"healthy" : true` in the returned JSON object.

:::note

If the node gets stuck during bootstrap (it takes far longer than the estimates given above), try adding the parameter `--bootstrap-retry-enabled=false`.

### Additional configuration

These are some of the most relevant CLI parameters you can use.
You can read about all of them in the [Avalanche documentation](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/maintain/avalanchego-config-flags).

- [`--bootstrap-ips`](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/maintain/avalanchego-config-flags#--bootstrap-ips-string),
  [`--bootstrap-ids`](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/maintain/avalanchego-config-flags#--bootstrap-ids-string):
  IP address and node ID of the peer used to connect to the rest of the network for bootstrapping.

  You can use Flare's public nodes for this, as shown in the quick start command given above:

  Peer's IP address:

  ```bash
  curl -m 10 -sX POST --data '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"info.getNodeIP" }' -H 'content-type:application/json;' https://flare.flare.network/ext/info | jq -r ".result.ip"
  ```

  Peer's node ID:

  ```bash
  curl -m 10 -sX POST --data '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"info.getNodeID" }' -H 'content-type:application/json;' https://flare.flare.network/ext/info | jq -r ".result.nodeID"
  ```

  Remember that you need to whitelist your node's IP address or your queries will always be answered with 403 error codes.

- [`--http-host`](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/maintain/avalanchego-config-flags#--http-host-string):
  Use `--http-host=` (empty) to allow connections from other machines.
  Otherwise, only connections from `localhost` are accepted.

- [`--http-port`](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/maintain/avalanchego-config-flags#--http-port-int):
  The port through which the node will listen to API requests.
  The default value is `9650`.

- [`--staking-port`](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/maintain/avalanchego-config-flags#--staking-port-int):
  The port through which the network peers will connect to this node externally.
  Having this port accessible from the internet is required for correct node operation.
  The default value is `9651`.

- [`--db-dir`](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/maintain/avalanchego-config-flags#--db-dir-string-file-path):
  Directory where the database is stored.
  Make sure to use a disk with enough space as recommended in the [Hardware prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
  It defaults to `~/.avalanchego/db` on Flare and Coston2, and to `~/.flare/db` on Songbird and Coston.

  For example, you can use this option to store the database on an external drive.

- [`--chain-config-dir`](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/maintain/avalanchego-config-flags#--chain-config-dir-string):
  Optional JSON configuration file, in case you want to use lots of non-default values.

  :::note[Sample configuration for observer nodes]

        These are the most common configuration options, put them in `<chain-config-dir>/C/config.json`.

        ```json
        {
            "snowman-api-enabled": false,
            "coreth-admin-api-enabled": false,
            "eth-apis": [
                "eth",
                "eth-filter",
                "net",
                "web3",
                "internal-eth",
                "internal-blockchain",
                "internal-transaction-pool"
            ],
            "rpc-gas-cap": 50000000,
            "rpc-tx-fee-cap": 100,
            "pruning-enabled": true,
            "local-txs-enabled": false,
            "api-max-duration": 0,
            "api-max-blocks-per-request": 0,
            "allow-unfinalized-queries": false,
            "allow-unprotected-txs": false,
            "remote-tx-gossip-only-enabled": false,
            "log-level": "info"
        }
        ```

### Archival nodes

An archival node keeps the whole history of the blockchain, instead of pruning old transactions. Set `"pruning-enabled": false` in the configuration file to disable pruning. Note that archival nodes require significantly more disk space than standard observer nodes.

## Node maintainance

In some cases, your node might not work correctly or you might receive unusual messages that appear difficult to troubleshoot.
Use the following solutions to ensure your node stays healthy:

- Remember that when your node has less than 16 peers, your node will not work correctly.
  To retrieve the number of connected peers, run the following command and find the line that contains `connectedPeers`:

  ```bash
  curl http://127.0.0.1:9650/ext/health | jq
  ```

  To automate the process, use:

  ```bash
  curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9650/ext/health | jq -r ".checks.network.message.connectedPeers"
  ```

- If your node does not sync after a long time and abruptly stops working, ensure the database location has sufficient disk space, and remember the database size might change a lot during bootstrapping.
- If you receive unusual messages after you make submissions or when transactions are reverted, your node might not be connected correctly.
  First, ensure the database location has sufficient disk space, and then restart the node.
- If you receive this error related to `GetAcceptedFrontier` during bootstrapping, your node was disconnected during bootstrapping.
- Restart the node.

  ```text
  failed to send GetAcceptedFrontier(MtF8bVH241hetCQJgsKEdKyJBs8vhp1BC, 11111111111111111111111111111111LpoYY, NUMBER)
  ```

* If you sync your node, but it stays unhealthy for no discernible reason, restart the node.
