## Functions

### allowance

Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be
allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through transferFrom. This is
zero by default.

This value changes when approve or transferFrom are called.

```solidity
function allowance(
    address owner,
    address spender
) external view returns (
    uint256
);
```

### approve

Sets a `value` amount of tokens as the allowance of `spender` over the
caller's tokens.

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.

IMPORTANT: Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk
that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate
transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race
condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the
desired value afterwards:
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729

Emits an Approval event.

```solidity
function approve(
    address spender,
    uint256 value
) external returns (
    bool
);
```

### balanceOf

Returns the value of tokens owned by `account`.

```solidity
function balanceOf(
    address account
) external view returns (
    uint256
);
```

### balanceOfAt

Queries the token balance of `_owner` at a specific `_blockNumber`.

```solidity
function balanceOfAt(
    address _owner,
    uint256 _blockNumber
) external view returns (
    uint256
);
```

| Parameters     | Type      | Description                                           |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `_owner`       | `address` | The address from which the balance will be retrieved. |
| `_blockNumber` | `uint256` | The block number to query.                            |

| Returns | Type      | Description                    |
| ------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| [0]     | `uint256` | The balance at `_blockNumber`. |

### batchDelegate

Undelegate all percentage delegations from the sender and then delegate corresponding
`_bips` percentage of voting power from the sender to each member of the `_delegatees` array.

```solidity
function batchDelegate(
    address[] _delegatees,
    uint256[] _bips
) external;
```

| Parameters    | Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_delegatees` | `address[]` | The addresses of the new recipients.                                                                                                                          |
| `_bips`       | `uint256[]` | The percentages of voting power to be delegated expressed in basis points (1/100 of one percent). The sum of all `_bips` values must be at most 10000 (100%). |

### cleanupBlockNumber

Get the current cleanup block number set with `setCleanupBlockNumber()`.

```solidity
function cleanupBlockNumber(
) external view returns (
    uint256
);
```

| Returns | Type      | Description                             |
| ------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| [0]     | `uint256` | The currently set cleanup block number. |

### decimals

Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
For example, if `decimals` equals 2, a balance of 505 tokens should
be displayed to a user as 5.05 (505 / 10<sup>2</sup>).

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
Ether and wei. This is the default value returned by this function, unless
it's overridden.

NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
balanceOf and transfer.

Should be compatible with ERC20 method.

```solidity
function decimals(
) external view returns (
    uint8
);
```

### delegate

Delegate voting power to account `_to` from `msg.sender`, by percentage.

```solidity
function delegate(
    address _to,
    uint256 _bips
) external;
```

| `_bips`    | `uint256` | The percentage of voting power to be delegated expressed in basis points (1/100 of one percent). Not cumulative: every call resets the delegation value (and a value of 0 revokes all previous delegations). |

### delegateExplicit

Explicitly delegate `_amount` voting power to account `_to` from `msg.sender`.
Compare with `delegate` which delegates by percentage.

```solidity
function delegateExplicit(
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount
) external;
```

| Parameters | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                |

### governanceVotePower

When set, allows token owners to participate in governance voting
and delegating governance vote power.

);
```

### name

Returns the name of the token.

Should be compatible with ERC20 method.

```solidity
function name(
) external view returns (
    string
);
```

### readVotePowerContract

Returns VPContract event interface used for read-only operations (view methods).
The only non-view method that might be called on it is `revokeDelegationAt`.

`readVotePowerContract` is almost always equal to `writeVotePowerContract`
except during an upgrade from one `VPContract` to a new version (which should happen
rarely or never and will be announced beforehand).

Do not call any methods on `VPContract` directly.
State changing methods are forbidden from direct calls.
All methods are exposed via `VPToken`.
This is the reason that this method returns `IVPContractEvents`.
Use it only for listening to events and revoking.

```solidity
function readVotePowerContract(
) external view returns (
    contract IVPContractEvents
);
```

### revokeDelegationAt

Revoke all delegation from sender to `_who` at given block.
Only affects the reads via `votePowerOfAtCached()` in the block `_blockNumber`.
Block `_blockNumber` must be in the past.
This method should be used only to prevent rogue delegate voting in the current voting block.
To stop delegating use delegate / delegateExplicit with value of 0 or undelegateAll / undelegateAllExplicit.

```solidity
function revokeDelegationAt(
    address _who,
    uint256 _blockNumber
) external;
```

| Parameters     | Type      | Description                                      |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `_who`         | `address` | Address of the delegatee.                        |
| `_blockNumber` | `uint256` | The block number at which to revoke delegation.. |

### setCleanerContract

Set the contract that is allowed to call history cleaning methods.

```solidity
function setCleanerContract(
    address _cleanerContract
) external;
```

| Parameters         | Type      | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_cleanerContract` | `address` | Address of the cleanup contract. Usually this will be an instance of `CleanupBlockNumberManager`. |

### setCleanupBlockNumber

Set the cleanup block number.
Historic data for the blocks before `cleanupBlockNumber` can be erased.
History before that block should never be used since it can be inconsistent.
In particular, cleanup block number must be lower than the current vote power block.

```solidity
function setCleanupBlockNumber(
    uint256 _blockNumber
) external;
```

| Parameters     | Type      | Description                   |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| `_blockNumber` | `uint256` | The new cleanup block number. |

### symbol

### writeVotePowerContract

Returns VPContract event interface used for state-changing operations (non-view methods).
The only non-view method that might be called on it is `revokeDelegationAt`.

`writeVotePowerContract` is almost always equal to `readVotePowerContract`,
except during upgrade from one `VPContract` to a new version (which should happen
rarely or never and will be announced beforehand).
In the case of an upgrade, `writeVotePowerContract` is replaced first to establish delegations.
After some period (e.g., after a reward epoch ends), `readVotePowerContract` is set equal to it.

Do not call any methods on `VPContract` directly.
State changing methods are forbidden from direct calls.
All are exposed via `VPToken`.
This is the reason that this method returns `IVPContractEvents`
Use it only for listening to events, delegating, and revoking.

```solidity
function writeVotePowerContract(
) external view returns (
    contract IVPContractEvents
);
```
