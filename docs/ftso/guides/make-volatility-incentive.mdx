:::info

Before reading this guide, make sure you understand the [FTSOv2 Architecture](/ftso/overview#architecture), in particular the [Volatility Incentive Mechanism](/ftso/overview#volatility-incentive-mechanism).

:::

This guide provides code examples demonstrating how to make an FTSOv2 volatility incentive offer using various programming languages. To make a volatility incentive offer, you need three key pieces of information:

1. **RPC Endpoint URL:** The RPC Endpoint URL determines which network your code will interact with. You can use a node provider service or point to your own client. A comprehensive list of public and private RPC endpoints for all Flare networks is available on the [Network Configuration](/network/overview#configuration) page.

2. **Contract Address:** The address for the `FastUpdateIncentiveManager` contract varies by network. You can obtain this address in two ways:

   - **From the Solidity Reference page:** Find the `FastUpdateIncentiveManager` address for each network on the [Solidity Reference](../solidity-reference) page.

   **OR**

   - **Query the FlareContractRegistry Contract:** The `FlareContractRegistry` contract has the same address across all networks. You can query it to get the `FastUpdateIncentiveManager` contract address. Refer to the specific language guides for examples:
     - [JavaScript](/network/guides/flare-for-javascript-developers#make-query)
     - [Python](/network/guides/flare-for-python-developers#make-query)
     - [Rust](/network/guides/flare-for-rust-developers#make-query)
     - [Go](/network/guides/flare-for-go-developers#make-query)

3. **Cost of Increasing the Sample Size:** FTSOv2 allows you to dynamically increase the sample size, i.e., the expected number of providers who can submit a block-latency feed update. The cost for this increases dynamically with the expected sample size. A single volatility incentive lasts for a period of 8 blocks.

All code examples in this guide are also available in the [developer-hub repository](https://github.com/flare-foundation/developer-hub/tree/main/code_examples).

        This example shows two ways, one using [web3.js](https://github.com/web3/web3.js) and the other using [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/), to make an FTSOv2 Volatility Incentive offer on Flare Testnet Coston2.
