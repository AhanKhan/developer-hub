The **F**lare **T**ime **S**eries **O**racle (FTSO) is an [enshrined oracle](../support/terminology#enshrined-oracle) that provides decentralized data feeds to the Flare network. Since the release of FTSOv1 two years ago, users and applications on Flare have enjoyed consistent and reliable pricing, with zero downtime or failures. FTSOv2 builds on the robust foundation laid by its predecessor, offering several enhancements:

- **Secure.** Enshrined into the core protocol of Flare, every oracle feed in FTSOv2 inherits the economic security of the entire network.

- **Fast.** Introducing block-latency feeds, FTSOv2 updates approximately every 1.8 seconds, making it over 90x faster than FTSOv1.

- **Scalable.** With the introduction of Scaling, FTSOv2 supports up to 1000 feeds, including historical data across various asset classes such as equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.

- **Decentralized.** With around 100 independent data providers per feed, selected by Flare users through delegated stakes, FTSOv2 ensures decentralization and imposes an economic cost for misbehavior.

- **Cost-effective.** Block-latency feeds in FTSOv2 are free to query (no gas costs) on Flare. Scaling feeds are also free to access and verify locally, with minimal gas costs for on-chain verification.

## Architecture

FTSOv2 ensures fast, secure, and manipulation-resistant feeds by using a stake-weighted verifiable randomness function (VRF) to select data providers for incremental delta updates. Scaling feeds anchor long-term accuracy, updating every 90 seconds, while volatility incentives temporarily increase the sample size during high market volatility for quicker responses.

The FTSOv2 architecture consists of four key components:

1. **Verifiably Random Selection:** Each block on Flare triggers the selection of a sample of data providers to deliver the next feed update. This process uses a stake-weighted verifiable randomness function (VRF), ensuring fairness and resistance to manipulation.

2. **Incremental Delta Update:** Selected data providers submit the new feed update as a fixed incremental delta applied to the previous feed value. The base increment size for all updates is `0.00125%`, maintaining a reliable and continuous selection of participants to ensure the integrity and accuracy of updates.

3. **Anchoring to Scaling Feeds:** FTSOv2 uses Scaling feeds as anchors to ensure long-term accuracy. Scaling feeds employ a full commit-reveal process across all data providers, with an inter-quartile range (IQR) band calculation, and update every price epoch (i.e., every 90 seconds).

4. **Volatility Incentive Mechanism:** To address periods of high market volatility, FTSOv2 introduces volatility incentives, temporarily increasing the sample size of selected data providers in exchange for a fee. This mechanism ensures a faster response to significant price movements.

### Verifiably Random Selection

Every block on Flare, generated approximately every 1.8 seconds, initiates the selection of a sample of data providers to deliver the next feed update. This selection process leverages a stake-weighted verifiable randomness function (VRF), where the likelihood of each data provider being chosen is proportional to their stake. The expected sample size is one, and data providers have no control over, nor knowledge of, when they will be selected.

Each block has a unique "seed" value, used by FTSOv2 data providers to generate a personal random score. This score, coupled with a cryptographic proof, ensures its authenticity and verifiability, preventing prediction or manipulation by others. Data providers are chosen based on their scores: those with scores below a certain threshold are selected to make updates. The selection probability is proportional to the data provider's stake or weight, allowing for weighted sampling where participants with higher stakes have a greater chance of being selected. This mechanism ensures fairness and resistance to manipulation.

To maintain security, the seed value evolves from block to block using pseudorandom methods. This approach balances security and randomness, preventing adversaries from influencing the selection process. The system is designed to be statistically robust, ensuring a reliable and continuous selection of participants to uphold the integrity and accuracy of updates.

### Incremental Delta Update

The selected data providers submit the new feed update, which is a fixed incremental delta applied to the previous feed value. The base increment size (in percent) for all updates is `0.00125%`, a value determined through extensive market analysis and approved by Flare governance. The delta can be in one of three directions:

    - **Up (+)**: The new feed value is incrementally increased from the previous value.
    - **Down (â€“)**: The new feed value is incrementally decreased from the previous value.
    - **Unchanged (0)**: The new feed value remains the same as the previous value.

### Anchoring to Scaling Feeds

FTSOv2 is designed to be statistically self-correcting. To further ensure the long-term accuracy of the feeds, FTSOv2 uses the [Scaling](./scaling/overview) feeds as anchors. Scaling feeds utilize a full commit-reveal process across all data providers with an inter-quartile range (IQR) band calculation and update one every price epoch (i.e., every 90 seconds). Data providers are only rewarded if the FTSOv2 feeds converge to the Scaling feeds every price epoch.

### Volatility Incentive Mechanism

From statistical analysis, FTSOv2's mechanism is capable capturing approximately 99.3% of all price movements under normal market conditions. However, during periods of high market volatility, the small size of each increment may be slower to reflect large price movements. To address this, FTSOv2 introduces volatility incentives, which allows for a temporary increase in the size of the selected sample of data providers in exchange for a fee. Without the incentive, the expected sample size is one. When the incentive is applied, the expected sample size is temporarily increased, allowing for more updates to made. This leads to a faster response to large price movements.
