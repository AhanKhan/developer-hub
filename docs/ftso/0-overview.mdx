The **F**lare **T**ime **S**eries **O**racle (FTSO) is an [enshrined oracle](../support/terminology#enshrined-oracle) that provides decentralized data feeds to the Flare network. Since the release of the FTSOv1 two years ago, users and applications on Flare have enjoyed consistent and reliable pricing, with zero downtime or failures. FTSOv2 expands on the robust foundation laid by its predecessor, and is:

- **Secure.** FTSOv2 is enshrined into the core protocol of Flare, and every single oracle feed inherits the economic security of the entire network.

- **Fast.** FTSOv2 introduces block-latency feeds, incrementally updating every â‰ˆ1.8 seconds on Flare. This is over 90x faster than FTSOv1.

- **Scalable.** FTSOv2 with Scaling supports up to 1000 feeds with historical data. Feeds include different asset classes such as equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.

- **Decentralized.** FTSOv2 has around 100 independent data providers for every feed. The providers are chosen by Flare users, whose delegated stake imposes an economic cost to misbehavior.

- **Cost-effective.** FTSOv2's block-latency feeds have no costs (not even gas!) to query on Flare. Feeds from Scaling are also free to access and verify locally, and only have minimal gas costs to verify on-chain.
