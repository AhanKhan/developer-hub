The **F**lare **T**ime **S**eries **O**racle (FTSO) is an [enshrined oracle](../support/terminology#enshrined-oracle) that provides decentralized data feeds to the Flare network. Since the release of FTSOv1 two years ago, users and applications on Flare have enjoyed consistent and reliable pricing, with zero downtime or failures. FTSOv2 builds on the robust foundation laid by its predecessor, offering several enhancements:

- **Secure.** Enshrined into the core protocol of Flare, every oracle feed in FTSOv2 inherits the economic security of the entire network.

- **Fast.** Introducing block-latency feeds, FTSOv2 updates approximately every 1.8 seconds, making it over 90x faster than FTSOv1.

- **Scalable.** With the introduction of Scaling, FTSOv2 supports up to 1000 feeds, including historical data across various asset classes such as equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.

- **Decentralized.** With around 100 independent data providers per feed, selected by Flare users through delegated stakes, FTSOv2 ensures decentralization and imposes an economic cost for misbehavior.

- **Cost-effective.** Block-latency feeds in FTSOv2 are free to query (no gas costs) on Flare. Scaling feeds are also free to access and verify locally, with minimal gas costs for on-chain verification.

## Architecture

FTSOv2 employs an innovative architecture that integrates a verifiable randomness selection process with a fixed incremental delta update. This design ensures a fast, secure feed that is resistant to manipulation and collusion. The architecture operates as follows:

**Selection.** Every block on Flare, approximately every 1.8 seconds, a subset of data providers is chosen to provide the next feed update. The selection process utilizes a stake-weighted verifiable randomness function (VRF). The probability of each data provider being selected is proportional to their stake. On average, a single data provider is randomly selected per block. Data providers have no control over, nor knowledge of, when they will be chosen.

**Update.** The selected data providers submit the new feed update, which is a fixed incremental delta applied to the previous feed value. The delta can be in one of three directions:

    - **Up (+)**: The new feed value is incrementally increased from the previous value.
    - **Down (â€“)**: The new feed value is incrementally decreased from the previous value.
    - **Unchanged (0)**: The new feed value remains the same as the previous value.

The base increment size for all feeds is `0.00125%`, a value determined through extensive market analysis. This increment is designed to capture approximately 99.3% of all price movements under normal market conditions. However, during periods of high market volatility, this small increment may be insufficient to reflect larger price movements. To address this, FTSOv2 introduces the Volatility Incentive Mechanism, which allows for a temporary increase in the increment size in exchange for a fee.

### Volatility Incentive Mechanism

In times of high market volatility, the increment size can be temporarily increased to better capture larger price movements. This requires the application of a volatility incentive, whereby the increment size is raised in exchange for a fee. Any user can request this incentive, and the fee scales exponentially with the size of the requested increment change. The maximum allowable increment size is capped at 0.2%.

## Scaling

FTSOv2 introduces a new feature called Scaling, allowing the expansion of the FTSO to support up to 1000 feeds with historical data. Scaling feeds update every 90 seconds and include different asset classes such as equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. With Scaling, feed data is stored off-chain and can be verified on-chain. The data is stored in a Merkle tree, with only the Merkle root published on-chain, enabling efficient verification.
