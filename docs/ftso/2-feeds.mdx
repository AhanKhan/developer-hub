FTSOv2's block-latency feeds update incrementally with each new block on Flare, approximately every 1.8 seconds. These feeds have a single entrypoint function and primarily support cryptocurrency price feeds. Moreover, they come with the added advantage of being completely free to query and utilize in your decentralized application on Flare, with no gas costs involved.

The feed indexes listed below serve as inputs to the [`fetchCurrentFeeds`](solidity-reference/IFastUpdater#fetchcurrentfeeds) entrypoint function. By passing an array of feed indexes to the function, you can query any number of feeds in a single call. However, attempting to query feeds outside of the supported indexes will result in the entire transaction reverting.

```solidity title="Entrypoint function signature"
function fetchCurrentFeeds(
    uint256[] _indices
) external view returns (
    uint256[] _feeds,
    int8[] _decimals,
    uint64 _timestamp
);
```
