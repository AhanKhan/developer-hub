You can use FTSOv2 to connect your smart contracts to real-world data feeds. FTSOv2 leverages Flare's network of 100 independent data providers to source off-chain data and deliver it on-chain. This section focuses on consuming FTSOv2's block-latency feeds on Flare with an on-chain Solidity contract.

:::note
If you are new to smart contract development, learn how to [deploy your first smart contract](../../guides/deploy-first-contract) before you start this guide.

To read FTSOv2 feeds off-chain or use different languages, see the language specific guides for [Python](../../guides/flare-for-python-developers), [Rust](../../guides/flare-for-rust-developers), [JavaScript](../../guides/flare-for-javascript-developers), or [Go](../../guides/flare-for-go-developers)

## Sample contract

This example smart contact queries the latest feed values for FLR/USD, BTC/USD and ETH/USD from FTSOv2 on Flare's Coston testnet.

```solidity title="FtsoV2FeedConsumer.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity <0.9.0;

import {IFastUpdater} from "@flarenetwork/flare-smart-contracts-v2/contracts/userInterfaces/IFastUpdater.sol";

/**
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT USING HARDCODED VALUES.
 * DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.
 */

contract FtsoV2FeedConsumer {
    IFastUpdater internal ftsoV2;
    // Feed indexes: 0 = FLR/USD, 2 = BTC/USD, 9 = ETH/USD
    uint256[] public feedIndexes = [0, 2, 9];

    /**
     * Network: Coston
     * Address: 0x9B931f5d3e24fc8C9064DB35bDc8FB4bE0E862f9

    constructor() {
        ftsoV2 = IFastUpdater(0x9B931f5d3e24fc8C9064DB35bDc8FB4bE0E862f9);
    }

    /**
     * Get the current value of the feeds.
     */
    function getFtsoV2CurrentFeedValues()
        public
        view
        returns (uint256[] memory _feedValues, int8[] memory _decimals)
    {
        return ftsoV2.fetchCurrentFeeds(feedIndexes);
    }
}
```

### Breaking down the contract

- The contract imports the `IFastUpdater` interface from the Flare smart contracts library. You can also see the interface's full [Solidity reference](solidity-reference/IFastUpdater).
- The contract defines an array of feed indexes to query. The indexes `[0, 2, 9]`correspond to FLR/USD, BTC/USD, and ETH/USD respectively.
- The contract initializes the `ftsoV2` variable with the address of the FTSOv2 contract on the Coston testnet.
- The `getFtsoV2CurrentFeedValues` function queries the FTSOv2 contract for the latest values of the specified feeds.

## Compile, deploy, and run the contract

:::info
If you have not already configured your MetaMask wallet to support Coston2 and funded it with testnet `C2FLR`, learn how to [deploy your first smart contract](../../guides/deploy-first-contract).

You can get testnet `C2FLR` from the [Coston2 Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2).

1. <Remix href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.8.25+commit.b61c2a91.js&optimize=true&runs=200&gist=d6181b71e7932701efbc6c3c78898f5a">Open the contract in Remix</Remix>

2. On the left side of Remix, click the **Solidity Compiler** tab to view the compiler settings. Expand **Advanced Configuration** and set **EVM Version** to `london`.

3. Click the **Compile FtsoV2FeedConsumer.sol** button to compile the contract.

4. On the **Deploy & Run transactions** tab, select the **Injected Provider** environment.

5. In the **Contract** section, select the `FtsoV2FeedConsumer` contract to make sure that Remix deploys the correct contract.

6. Click **Deploy** to deploy the contract to the Coston2 testnet. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm payment for deploying the contract. Make sure MetaMask is set to the Coston2 testnet before you confirm the transaction.

7. In the MetaMask prompt, click **Confirm** to approve the transaction and spend your testnet C2FLR required to deploy the contract.

8. After a few seconds, the transaction completes and your contract appears under the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Click the contract dropdown to view its variables and functions.

9. Click `getFtsoV2CurrentFeedValues` to show the latest feed values and decimals.

The first `feedValues` array will contain the current prices of FLR/USD, BTC/USD and ETH/USD in the same order as the feed indexes were given. The second `decimals` array will contain the decimal places for the corresponding feeds. The floating point price of a feed can be calculated by dividing the `feedValue` by 10^`decimals`. For example, if the feed value of BTC/USD is `6900420` and the decimal is `2`, the floating point feed value is `69004.20`.
