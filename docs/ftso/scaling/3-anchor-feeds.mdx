Scaling's anchor feeds update every 90 seconds with each new voting epoch on Flare. These feeds, accessible off-chain, support various asset classes including equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.

Each anchor feed is uniquely identified by an ID composed of three components in a structured encoding process:

1. **Category:** Indicates the type of asset:

   - Crypto: `01`
   - Forex: `02`
   - Commodity: `03`
   - Stock: `04`

2. **Hex-Encoded Feed Name:** The name of the feed is converted to a hexadecimal format.

3. **Zero Padding:** The combined category and hex-encoded feed name are padded with zeros to a length of 21 bytes.

The resulting string is then prefixed with `0x`.

<summary>Example of the structured encoding process.</summary>

Taking the feed name `FLR/USD`:

- **Category**: `01` (Crypto)
- **Hex-Encoded Feed Name**: `464c522f555344` (hexadecimal representation of `FLR/USD`)
- **Zero Padding**: The category and hex-encoded feed name combined and padded: `01464c522f55534400000000000000000000000000`
- **Final ID**: Adding the `0x` prefix results in `0x01464c522f55534400000000000000000000000000`

Feed IDs are not addresses, they are simply a structured encoding of the category and feed name to ensure that each anchor feed has a unique ID.
