## FAQs

### Why am I getting `invalid opcode: opcode 0x5f not defined`?

Flare supports EVM versions up to London, which does not support the `PUSH0` opcode.

Learn how to set the EVM version for your compiler in the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#setting-the-evm-version-to-target).

```json
// In the standard Solidity JSON interface
{
  "settings": {
    "optimizer": {
      /* ... */
    },
    "evmVersion": "london"
  }
}
```

### Where can I get Flare testnet tokens?

You can get:

- Flare Testnet Coston2 `C2FLR` tokens from the [Coston2 Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2).

- Songbird Testnet Coston `CFLR` tokens from the [Coston Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston).

To understand the difference between Coston and Coston2, see the [Network Configuration](../flare/configuration) page.
