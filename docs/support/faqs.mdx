### Why am I getting `invalid opcode: opcode 0x5f not defined`?

Flare supports EVM versions up to London, which does not support the `PUSH0` opcode, leading to this error. To fix this:

- In the standard Solidity JSON interface

  ```json
  {
    "settings": {
      "optimizer": {
        /* ... */
      },
      "evmVersion": "london"
    }
  }
  ```

- In the `solc` CLI
  ```bash
  solc --evm-version london
  ```

Learn more about how to set the EVM version for your compiler in the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#setting-the-evm-version-to-target).

### Where can I get Flare testnet tokens?

You can get:

- Testnet C2FLR from the [Coston2 Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2).

- Testnet CFLR from the [Coston Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston).

To understand the difference between Coston and Coston2, see the [Network Configuration](../network#configuration) page.
