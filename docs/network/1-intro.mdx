# Flare ☀️

Flare is the blockchain for data. It providers developers and users with secure decentralized access to high-integrity data from other chains and the internet. Flare is a layer 1 blockchain that is EVM compatible.

## Getting started

- [Deploy your first smart contract](../../blog/deploy-first-contract) - Build and deploy your first on-chain Flare smart contract, using only your browser
- [Learn how to use the FTSO](../../blog/learn-how-to-use-the-ftso) - The Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) is a decentralized oracle that provides data to smart contracts on Flare

## Start learning

Build a strong understanding of the core concepts that make Flare different from other blockchains.

- [Enshrining](../../blog/what-is-enshrining) - Leveraging the entire security of the Flare network to secure its core protocols
- [On-chain governance](../../blog/how-flare-governance-works) - Flare is controlled by its community of users, who can vote on changes to the network
- [Delegated Proof-of-Stake](../../blog/what-is-dpos) - Flare's consensus mechanism, which allows users to vote for validators to secure the network

## Understand the architecture

Get to know the underlying architecture of how Flare works.

- [Validators](../../blog/what-is-a-flare-validator) - Validators are responsible for securing the network and checking the validity of transactions
- [Data Providers](.../../blog/what-is-a-flare-data-provider) - Data Providers are responsible for sourcing off-chain data and bringing it to Flare

## Contribute to Flare

- [Run a Flare validator](validator-node-client) - Secure the Flare network and earn rewards by running a validator node
- [Become an FTSO data provider](../guides/become-a-data-provider) - Help secure the Flare network by providing high-integrity data to smart contracts
- [Contribute to the Flare codebase](../guides/contribute-to-flare) - Help build the future of Flare by contributing to the open-source codebase
