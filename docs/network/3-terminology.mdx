# Terminology

## Account

: In blockchain, an account is a place to store tokens and smart contracts. Accounts are generated from private keys, and you typically need to know an account's private key to be able to transfer any token out of it. The crypto saying "Not your keys, not your coins" refers to this fact. An account is a synonym for wallet and address.

## Address

: In blockchain, an address is a synonym for wallet and [account](#account).

## Attestation

: A data proof provided to the [State Connector](state_connector) by a decentralized set of Attestation Providers that confirms the validity or otherwise of any request. [Read more...](state-connector.md)

## Autoclaiming

: Automatic claiming enables users to appoint an executor to claim rewards on their behalf. [Read more...](./automatic-claiming.md)

## Avalanche

: An open-source blockchain using the Snow family of consensus protocols and Proof of Stake for Sybil resistance #sybil_resistance. It is advertised as the fastest smart contract platform. [Read more...](https://docs.avax.network/)

## Block

: For performance reasons, blockchains do not process transactions one by one. Instead, transactions are grouped together in blocks which are then validated by the consensus algorithm.

## Block Explorer

: A tool that enables its users to analyze transactions and interact with addresses on blockchains. [Read more...](../user/block-explorers/index.md)

## Blockchain

: Digital ledger storing data and transactions on a distributed network of computers to make it more robust. Cryptography protects against information tampering, and a consensus algorithm ensures that the majority of the network agrees on the stored data even if some of its nodes act maliciously.

## Bootstrapping Node

: An observation node associated with a validator node and acting as its bastion: the bootstrapping node exposes a minimum RPC interface, so the validator does not have to. The nodeID and nodeIP returned by the bootstrapping node's RPC allow an external node to connect and peer with the core network of validators. The bootstrapping node also [gossips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol) the core network's validators nodeIDs and nodeIPs to the external node to peer to. The main purpose of a bootstrapping node is to allow new nodes to connect to the network (hence the name "bootstrapping") while reducing its associated validator node attack surface. [Flare offers some public bootstrapping nodes](../dev/reference/network-config.md#flare-networks).

## Bridge

: A protocol that connects otherwise independent blockchains, enabling interoperability between them. Read more about Flare's bridging: LayerCake.
